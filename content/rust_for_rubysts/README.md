## Rust for Rubysts

Rust is an Open Source programming language, which started from a necessity from the Mozilla
team to have a better (safer) language to develop a rendering engine for Firefox. We have some
big names from Ruby Community "playing" with Rust, Steve Klabnik, Yehuda Katz and some others.
Also Yehuda's company, Tilde, is adopting Rust in production for Skylight. Rust is definitely
a different language when compared to Ruby, but still pretty interesting. I found myself
interested on it to try something different. I believe that learning is an amazing process,
and the act of learning something completely different is really helpful for you, because you
can open you thinking to new ideas not explored by you yet. Rust done this to me and to my
understanding of the Ruby language. In this talk, I want to present some key and basic
concepts of Rust and also give some comparison with Ruby. Concepts of ownership, borrowing,
immutability and a few other would be covered here, a long with some basic explanation of how
Rust handles memory allocations.
